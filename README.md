# Surfs_up
For our client, W. Avy, our goal was to determine if it would be sensible to open up another Surf and Ice Cream shop. To determine how sustainable the busiess would be, we pulled the weather statistics for the months of June and December. 
When we look at the temperatures in June, the average temperature is 75 degrees. The highest temperature for the month was 85 degrees. So it would make a lot of sense for W. Avy to have a Surf and Ice Cream shop during the summer months.
